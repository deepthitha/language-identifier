Natural language processing, or NLP, combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical and machine learning models to enable computers and digital devices to recognize, understand and generate text and speech.

A branch of artificial intelligence (AI), NLP lies at the heart of applications and devices that can

translate text from one language to another
respond to typed or spoken commands
recognize or authenticate users based on voice
summarize large volumes of text
assess the intent or sentiment of text or speech
generate text or graphics or other content on demand
often in real time. Today most people have interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline and automate business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.
